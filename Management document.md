# Management document

## Individual:

__What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?__

__Which agile methods exist and which are most popular__

__Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book?__

__Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum?__

__Kanban:__ 

this method is based on visualizing and managing work. Kanban uses boards to track work items and their status during the stages of development; to-do, busy, up for review, done. Kanban is based on continuous delivery.

__Lean:__ 

Lean is similar to Kanban however it is focused on eliminating waste and obstructions to workflow. It is optimized for continuous learning and improvement.

__Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods? (to answer this question, we advise that you arrange a visit to a company)__

De Volksbank works with Kanban boards to work on their IT-solutions. Multiple teams work on multiple problems, so they need tools to help organize their progress and status. They use for example Azure DevOps to monitor their boards.

__Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?__ 

We are currently using Trello for our kanban board, a physical board would work as well. Kanban works quite well for our team. Some other tools are Jira and Azure DevOps. Git also allows to manage a primitive kanban board. Trello does not allow for full Kanban and or Scrum. Things like a burndown chart and user stories are missing in the tool.
